Thank you for calling Guardian Investment Services, this is Rachel speaking. How may I help you today?
Hi Rachel, this is Daniel Patel. I'm calling about some transactions in my account that haven't gone through yet. It's been several days now and I'm getting concerned.
I understand, Mr. Patel. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Before we begin, could I please verify some information? Would you mind providing your account number and the last four digits of your social security number?
Sure. The account number is, um, 775-90142, and the last four of my social are 6589.
Perfect, thank you for that information, Mr. Patel. I have your account pulled up now. So you mentioned some delayed transactions—could you tell me a bit more about what's going on?
Yeah, so last week—this was on February 13th—I initiated three wire transfers. Two were going out and one was coming in. The money has definitely left the sending accounts, I've confirmed that, but they're still not showing up in my accounts. And now I'm getting hit with overdraft fees because I was counting on that money being there.
I'm really sorry to hear that, Mr. Patel. That sounds frustrating. Let me take a look at those transfers for you... Yes, I can see them here in our system. You're right, they were initiated on February 13th. There appears to be... hmm, let me check something else here.
Is there a problem?
Well, I'm seeing that there's been a flag raised by our compliance department on these transactions. This sometimes happens with multiple transfers occurring simultaneously, especially when they're larger amounts.
But why am I just hearing about this now? I've called three times already this week, and nobody said anything about compliance issues.
I sincerely apologize for that, Mr. Patel. You absolutely should have been notified. That's definitely a breakdown in our communication, and I apologize for the frustration it's caused you.
Look, I've been banking with you guys for what, five years now? These are completely normal transactions for my business. Nothing unusual about them at all.
You're absolutely right, and with your history, this should have been handled differently. Let me confirm—the outgoing transfers are for $45,000 and $32,000, and you have an incoming transfer of $68,000, is that correct?
Yes, that's exactly right. And every day this gets delayed costs me money. I've got vendors waiting on payment, and it's making me look bad.
I completely understand. This isn't acceptable, and I want to help get this resolved for you right away. What I'm going to do is escalate this to our priority review team immediately. I'm adding notes about your situation and the urgency here.
How long is that going to take? Because honestly, I'm at my wit's end with this whole situation.
I understand. Even with the escalation, it could take another 24 to 48 hours for the review to complete. I wish I could give you a faster timeline, but I want to be honest with you.
Two more days? That's—look, I don't mean to be difficult, but that's just not acceptable. I can't keep doing business like this. Once these transfers finally clear, I think I'm going to need to close my account.
I... I completely understand your position, Mr. Patel. While we would certainly hate to lose your business, I respect your decision and can help with that process if that's what you decide. Would you like me to send you the necessary forms to begin that process?
Yes, please do. And I want something in writing explaining these delays and why they happened. I've lost thousands in overdraft fees and missed payment discounts because of this.
Absolutely. I'll put together detailed documentation of everything that's happened, including the timeline of your transfers and this compliance review. I'll also request a review of any fees incurred as a direct result of these delays—we may be able to reimburse those for you.
And what about right now? I still need these transfers processed as soon as possible.
I'm adding an urgent flag to your case as we speak. You should receive a call from our priority review team within the next hour. They'll be able to explain exactly what's needed to clear these transfers and can give you more specific information than I can.
Alright... just make sure they actually call. And please send those closure forms right away.
I'll email everything to you within the next 15 minutes. Let me just confirm—your email is still dpatel@email.com?
Yes, that's right.
Great. I'll send all the documentation and forms right away. Again, Mr. Patel, I want to sincerely apologize for this situation and the frustration it's caused you. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
No, just make sure that review team calls me within the hour like you said.
They will definitely call you, Mr. Patel. I've flagged this as highest priority. Thank you for your patience through all of this. I know it's been extremely frustrating.
Thanks for your help today. Goodbye.
Thank you, Mr. Patel. Have a good rest of your day. Goodbye.
