Hey, listen, um, I've been trying to get through to someone about my 403(b) for like, what, three weeks now? And nobody's giving me a straight answer.
I understand. I'm here to help. Can you tell me more about the specific issue you're experiencing?
Right, so here's the deal. I checked my account online, and something looks totally off. The contributions aren't matching what I thought I was putting in. Like, seriously, what's going on with that?
Let me pull up your account and review the recent contribution details. Could you confirm your full name and last four digits of your social security number?
Yeah, yeah. John Martinez. Social ends in 6242. I mean, I've been at my school district for fifteen years, and I always set up my contributions to max out. But these numbers? They don't add up.
I'm reviewing your account now, Mr. Martinez. I see your contributions for the past three pay periods. Would you like me to walk you through the details?
Um, yeah. Absolutely. Because something feels weird, you know? I'm putting money away for retirement, and I need to make sure everything's square.
Based on your contribution elections, you're currently setting aside $750 per paycheck, which translates to an annual contribution of $18,000. Does that align with your understanding?
Wait, what? No, I thought I was doing the catch-up contribution since I'm over 50. That should be different, right?
You're correct. For 2024, individuals over 50 can contribute up to $23,000 annually, plus an additional catch-up contribution of $7,500. Would you like me to verify your specific election?
Okay, yeah. Do that. Because something's not clicking for me.
After reviewing your account, I can confirm that your current election is set at the standard rate, not the catch-up contribution rate. Would you like me to help you adjust that?
Oh, geez. That explains everything. So I've been thinking I was maxing out, but I'm actually not? Man, this is why I get so frustrated with financial paperwork.
I'll help you update your contribution election right now to ensure you're maximizing your retirement savings. Would you like to proceed?
Yes, please. And hey, I appreciate you walking me through this. These forms can be a real nightmare.
I'm glad we could clarify this for you, Mr. Martinez. I'll make the changes, and you'll see the updated contribution in your next pay period.
Awesome. Thanks a lot.
